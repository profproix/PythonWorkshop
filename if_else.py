# Conditional statements allow us to perform different calculations or actions based on conditions.

# If statements:
# An if statement will run the indented block of code if the condition evaluates to True.
# == is the comparison operator, which checks if two values are equal. For example:


# If-else statements:
# An if-else statement runs the code in the if block if the condition is True,
# otherwise, it runs the code in the else block.
# Try running the code below. Then update `favAnimal` to another animal and run it again!


# If-elif-else statements:
# These allow you to check multiple conditions.


# Bringing it all together:


# Initialize variables to store the total heights for high and low tides


# Iterate through the tides list to calculate the total height for high and low tides

# Calculate the average heights for high and low tides


# Print the results using concatenation


# Exercise üìù
# Gather the dictionaries for each of your group members into a list.
# Loop through the list and perform a conditional statement on each element.
# For example, you can check if any group members have similar hobbies
# or find the oldest or youngest member in the group.
